# Epsi File Compressor

## Usage

 - ```git clone https://github.com/Aschen/ecf-compressor/```
 - ```cd ecf-compressor```
 - ```make```
 - ```./ecf```

Then you can verify files integrity :

 - ```cd tmp_dest```
 - ```make```
 - ```./ecf```

## Run tests

 - ```cd test```
 - ```qmake && make```
 - ```./test```

(Sometime the test is blocked and I have to sigkill the program and restart it..)
